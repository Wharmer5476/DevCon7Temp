Was following the tutorial here:
http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/11/real-time-geolocation-service-with-node-js/

Got up to the "THE CLIENT SIDE" heading, but got lost as I couldn't find the
file they were talking about: "./public/js/application.js"

Maybe we have to pull down the leaflet.js library?

We could always just nick his working copy off his GitHub :D
